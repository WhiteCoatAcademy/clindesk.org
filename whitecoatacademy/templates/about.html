          <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        </div>
          <p class="lead">White Coat Academy comprises a team of senior medical students and resident physicians who are deeply familiar with
              medical knowledge and education. Our recent experiences in medical school have helped shape our view that
              there is a disconnect between the training of physicians and the way patients learn about and understand
              their health.</p>
          <p class="lead">Our mission is to lead the transition of medical education from a proprietary to “open” process. We believe
              this process should be scalable and agile -- health literacy should be accessible to everyone in a
              context-appropriate fashion.</p>
          <p class="lead">With that goal in mind, we have designed and built White Coat Academy.org, a free video library that opens medical
              education to patients and their families and friends. Our videos are organized by medical speciality and
              specific disease, which walk you through the basic biology, “who and when” epidemiology, symptoms, and
              treatment/outcomes of each condition you or someone you know might be facing.</p>
          <p class="lead">We hope to clearly and concisely extend medical education to patients in an “open” fashion, providing them
              with the most important information about diseases or conditions they may be confronted with.</p>
